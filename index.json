Canvas : We will not use it from now on for content, but for the sake of completeness. However, you will still find your calendar there and we may use it from time to time to send out mass-mails to you all. Datacamp : Get access to all the Datacamp premium content for free to facilitate your data science journey. Use your CBS mail here when signing up. Adittional Infrastructure used Data Science Cloud services Collaborative coding and presentation Github Provides internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It is also commonly used to host open-source projects, including data science projects. If you do not have it already, you are advice to create an account to manage and showcase your work during this semester. Cloud-based computational notebook: Google Colab: Googles popular service for editing, running \u0026amp; sharing Jupyter notebooks (Only Python Kernel, but R kernel can be accessed via some tricks). Has a pro version for some 10$ in case you need further ressources. You can also easily mount your google drive to directly acess your data. Deepnote: New popular online notebook service with good integration to other services (Python, R \u0026amp; more) Kaggle: Also provides their own cloud-based service co create and run computational notebooks. Convenient, unlimited, but a bit slow (Pyhton, R ). Cloud-Computing UCLOUD: DK university collaboration for HPC. Apparently, CBS is now also on board (untested) Getting started Jupyter/Colab Intro Python Colab Github Hello World The Markdown Guide: Introduction to markdown, the formating language used in ipython notebooks.

Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.\nM3: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics Introduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.\n"},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/03_schedule/","title":"Semester Schedule","tags":[],"description":"","content":"M1: Week 36-38 Topics W 36: Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization W 37: Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML), Supervised Machine Learning (SML) W 38: Workshop \u0026amp; project work M2: Week 39-41 Topics W 39: Introduction to Network Analysis W 40: Introduction to Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) W 41: Workshop \u0026amp; project work M3: Week 43-46 Topics W 43: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) \u0026amp; Deep Learning (DL) W 44: Neural networks for spatial data: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) W 45: Neural Networks for sequential data: Recurrent Neural networks (RNN \u0026amp; LSTM) W 46: Workshop \u0026amp; project work Key Dates In-person workshops on CBS campus (mostly Thursday + Friday)\n1: W38: Machine learning case studies 2: W41: Advanced applications in Network and Text Analysis 3: W46: Advanced applications \u0026amp; outlook in deep learning Individual assignment (2 out of 3 need to be passed):\n1: 23.-28.09.2022, 23:59:00 at the latest (Peergrade) 2: 14.-26.10.2022, 23:59:00 at the latest (Peergrade) 3: 14.-16.11.2022, 23:59:00 at the latest (Peergrade) Final exam (individual exam of group project)\nHand-out: 18.11.2022 Hand-in: 01.12.2021 Final exam: 16.12.2021 "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m1/01_warmup/02_ecosystem/","title":"The Data Science Ecosystem","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Use the tabs to access content\nThis Video series contains an introduction to the data science ecosystem, includng a general as well as a R and Python specific overview.\nR Ecosystem Python Ecosystem DS Ecosystem general Video Slides Video Slides Video Slides "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/04_litetrature/","title":"Literature &amp; Resources","tags":[],"description":"","content":"While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in python and R, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.
