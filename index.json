Canvas : We will not use it from now on for content, but for the sake of completeness. However, you will still find your calendar there and we may use it from time to time to send out mass-mails to you all. Datacamp : Get access to all the Datacamp premium content for free to facilitate your data science journey. Use your CBS mail here when signing up. Adittional Infrastructure used Github Provides internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It is also commonly used to host open-source projects, including data science projects. If you do not have it already, you are advice to create an account to manage and showcase your work during this semester. A brief introduction into the main functionalists can be found here.

We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.\nMain Literature These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using R and Python. We will frequently refer to selected chapters for further study.\nPython VanderPlas, J. (2016). Python data science handbook: Essential tools for working with data. O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Media, Inc.

We hope you are excited.\nNote that this page rather than Canvas will represent the central hub for teaching material. At DSBA we believe in the power of open science and open education, and consequently we make all our material available outside password protected university systems.\nThe corresponding canvas course page can be found here, and will not be updated for other things than providing the live-lecture calendar.\n"},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
