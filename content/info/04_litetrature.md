While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in python and R, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.  We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.

## Main Literature

These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using R and Python. We will frequently refer to selected chapters for further study.

## Further Ressources

### Community

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Crowdsourced data science challanges. Nowadays also provides a vivid community where you find datasets, notebooks for all kind of data science exercises. 
* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): Q&A community for coding issues. Most coding questions you could come up with have already been answered, or will be answered fast (if you ask right ;)).
* [Danish Data Science Community](https://www.ddsc.io/): Community of Data Scientist here in DK. Go here for finding project partners, check whats thrending in Danish DS, and ask conceptual questions.
