We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.
Main Literature These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using R and Python.</description></item><item><title>Semester Schedule</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/03_schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/03_schedule/</guid><description>M1: Week 36-38 Topics W 36: Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization W 37: Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML), Supervised Machine Learning (SML) W 38: Workshop &amp;amp; project work M2: Week 39-41 Topics W 39: Introduction to Network Analysis W 40: Introduction to Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) W 41: Workshop &amp;amp; project work M3: Week 43-46 Topics W 43: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) &amp;amp; Deep Learning (DL) W 44: Neural networks for spatial data: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) W 45: Neural Networks for sequential data: Recurrent Neural networks (RNN &amp;amp; LSTM) W 46: Workshop &amp;amp; project work Key Dates In-person workshops on CBS campus (mostly Thursday + Friday) 1: W38: Machine learning case studies 2: W41: Advanced applications in Network and Text Analysis 3: W46: Advanced applications &amp;amp; outlook in deep learning</description></item></channel></rss>
