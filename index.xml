This session is a basic introduction to statistical programming as well as a short brush-up on data more generally. For some, this will be &amp;ldquo;old news&amp;rdquo;, but many will certainly benefit from reviewing this material. We start with a generall theory lecture on data structures and properties, and then dive into R and Python specific applications of statistical programming.</description></item><item><title>Day 1 UML</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m1/09_workshops/w1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m1/09_workshops/w1/</guid><description>Practical info Place: Ovnhallen Time: 11.40-17.00

M1: Applied Data Science and Machine Learning This module will prove a condensed introduction to the “Data Science Pipeline”, introducing students to methods, techniques, and workflows in applied data analytics and machine learning, including data acquisition, preparation, analysis, visualization, and communication.
M2: Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing Focuses on analyzing a variety of unstructured data sources. Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.</description></item><item><title>Semester Schedule</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/03_schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/03_schedule/</guid><description>M1: Week 36-38 Topics W 36: Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization W 37: Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML), Supervised Machine Learning (SML) W 38: Workshop &amp;amp; project work M2: Week 39-41 Topics W 39: Introduction to Network Analysis W 40: Introduction to Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) W 41: Workshop &amp;amp; project work M3: Week 43-46 Topics W 43: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) &amp;amp; Deep Learning (DL) W 44: Neural networks for spatial data: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) W 45: Neural Networks for sequential data: Recurrent Neural networks (RNN &amp;amp; LSTM) W 46: Workshop &amp;amp; project work Key Dates In-person workshops on CBS campus (mostly Thursday + Friday)</description></item><item><title>The Data Science Ecosystem</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m1/01_warmup/02_ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m1/01_warmup/02_ecosystem/</guid><description> Use the tabs to access content

The reason behind the framework&amp;rsquo;s success is the ease with which it allows data scientists to build data-driven web apps without the need to deal with frontend development or other dev-ops stuff while allowing them to incorporate all kinds of functions going far beyond just dashboards. Going from a Jupyter Notebook to a Streamlit app just requires adding a few lines of code and rewriting a few minor things.</description></item><item><title>Semester Project Requirements</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/05_requirements_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/05_requirements_project/</guid><description>Format Project report (30-ish pages - max. 45&amp;hellip; depending on group size) Some study relation (but that is debatable and not necessarily required) Report is a (semi/non) technical documentation.
