This session is a basic introduction to statistical programming as well as a short brush-up on data more generally. For some, this will be &amp;ldquo;old news&amp;rdquo;, but many will certainly benefit from reviewing this material. We start with a generall theory lecture on data structures and properties, and then dive into R and Python specific applications of statistical programming.</description></item><item><title>Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m3/02_cnn_rnn/1_cnn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m3/02_cnn_rnn/1_cnn/</guid><description>Use the tabs to access content.

We expect you to get frustrated and learn from it 😅. Don&amp;rsquo;t give up too early.
You get a real-world dataset form a job-search platform.

There are 4 dataframes in this dataset.
jobs.csv: detailed data about the job listings. title, description, location, etc. user_work_interest.csv: self-identified interests of the users user_past_experience.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Prototyping with Streamlit</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m1/02_basics/04-interactive-dataviz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/m1/02_basics/04-interactive-dataviz/</guid><description>Streamlit was first released in October 2019 and has gained enormous popularity in the past year. The reason behind the framework&amp;rsquo;s success is the ease with which it allows data scientists to build data-driven web apps without the need to deal with frontend development or other dev-ops stuff while allowing them to incorporate all kinds of functions going far beyond just dashboards. Going from a Jupyter Notebook to a Streamlit app just requires adding a few lines of code and rewriting a few minor things.</description></item><item><title>Semester Project Requirements</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/05_requirements_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2022/info/05_requirements_project/</guid><description>Format Project report (30-ish pages - max. 45&amp;hellip; depending on group size) Some study relation (but that is debatable and not necessarily required) Report is a (semi/non) technical documentation.
